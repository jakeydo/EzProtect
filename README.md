#EzProtect
##DOES NOT WORK
##PocketMine plugin

EzProtect is an easy plugin for PocketMine to protect builds. It assigns a certain portion of the world to a player, allowing only that player to place or destroy blocks. It ignores height.


Currently only allows a player named "Jake" to destroy blocks throughout the entire world.

How to make it work, just using the "reload" command doesn't load Devtools source plugins:
1. Install the Devtools plugin
2. Put the EzProtect folder inside the \plugins\ folder
3. Stop the server
4. Start the server again
